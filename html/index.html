                        "Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional Unix environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are." 
                    </p>
                    <p>-- from <strong>man intro(1)</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This page gives an introduction to using the command-line interface terminal, from now on abbreviated to the <strong>terminal</strong>. There are many varieties of Linux, but almost all of them use similar commands that can be entered from the terminal. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also many graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but each of them works differently and there is little standardization between them. Experienced users who work with many different Linux distributions therefore find it easier to learn commands that can be used in all varieties of Ubuntu and, indeed, in other Linux distributions as well. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the novice, commands can appear daunting: 
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    sudo gobbledegook blah_blah -w -t -h --long-switch 
    aWkward/ComBinationOf/mixedCase/underscores_strokes/and.dots
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        However, it is important to note that even experienced users often cut and paste commands (from a guide or manual) into the terminal; they do not memorize them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important, of course, to know how to use the terminal - and anyone who can manage typing, backspacing, and cutting and pasting will be able to use the terminal (it is not more difficult than that).

                        <p>
                            Unity is the default desktop environment used as of 11.04. Where systems are not ready for Unity they revert to GNOME which is also used in previous releases such as Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid), see next sub-section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The easiest way to open the terminal is to use the 'search' function on the dash. Or you can click on the 'More Apps' button, click on the 'See more results' by the installed section, and find it in that list of applications. A third way, available after you click on the 'More Apps' button, is to go to the search bar, and see that the far right end of it says 'All Applications'. You then click on that, and you'll see the full list. Then you can go to Accessories -> Terminal after that. So, the methods in Unity are:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Dash</strong> -> <strong>Search for Terminal</strong>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Dash</strong> -> <strong>More Apps</strong> -> <strong>'See More Results'</strong> -> <strong>Terminal</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The sudo command executes a command with administrative privileges (root-user administrative level), which is necessary, for example, when working with directories or files not owned by your user account. When using sudo you will be prompted for your password. Only users with administrative privileges are allowed to use sudo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be careful when executing commands with administrative privileges - you might damage your system! You should <strong>never</strong>> use normal sudo to start graphical applications with administrative privileges. Please see

                                The tilde (~) symbol stands for your home directory. If you are user, then the tilde (~) stands for /home/user

                                <strong>pwd</strong>>: The <strong>pwd</strong>> command will allow you to know in which directory you're located (<strong>pwd</strong>> stands for "print working directory"). Example: <strong>pwd</strong>> in the Desktop directory will show "~/Desktop". Note that the GNOME Terminal also displays this information in the title bar of its window. A useful gnemonic is "present working directory."

                                <strong>ls</strong>: The <strong>ls</strong> command will show you ('list') the files in your current directory. Used with certain options, you can see sizes of files, when files were made, and permissions of files. Example: <strong>ls ~</strong> will show you the files that are in your home directory. 
                            </li>

                                <strong>cd</strong>: The <strong>cd</strong> command will allow you to change directories. When you open a terminal you will be in your home directory. To move around the file system you will use <strong>cd</strong>. Examples:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        To navigate into the root directory, use <strong>cd /</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To navigate to your home directory, use <strong>cd</strong> or <strong>cd ~</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To navigate one directory level, use <strong>cd ..</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use <strong>cd -</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, specify the full directory path that you want to go to. For example, use, <strong>cd /var/www</strong> to go directly to the /www subdirectory of /var/. As another example, <strong>cd ~/Desktop</strong> will move you to the Desktop subdirectory inside your home directory.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>cp</strong>: The <strong>cp</strong> command will make a copy of a file for you. Example: <strong>cp file foo</strong> will make an exact copy of "file" and name it "foo", but the file "file" will still be there. If you are copying a directory, you must use <strong>cp -r directory foo</strong> (copy recursively). (To understand what "recursively" means, think of it this way: to copy the directory and all its files and subdirectories and all their files and subdirectories of the subdirectories and all their files, and on and on, "recursively"). 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>mv</strong>: The <strong>mv</strong> command will move a file to a different location or will rename a file. Examples are as follows: <strong>mv file foo</strong> will rename the file "file" to "foo". <strong>mv foo ~/Desktop</strong> will move the file "foo" to your Desktop directory, but it will not rename it. You must specify a new file name to rename a file.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        To save on typing, you can substitute '~' in place of the home directory.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Note that if you are using <strong>mv</strong> with <strong>sudo</strong> you can use the ~ shortcut, because the terminal expands the ~ to your home directory. However, when you open a root shell with <strong>sudo -i</strong> or <strong>sudo -s</strong>, ~ will refer to the root account's home directory, not your own. 
                                    </li>
                                </ol> 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>rm</strong>: Use this command to remove or delete a file in your directory.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>rmdir</strong>: The <strong>rmdir</strong> command will delete an empty directory. To delete a directory and all of its contents recursively, use <strong>rm -r</strong> instead.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>mkdir</strong>: The <strong>mkdir</strong> command will allow you to create directories. Example: <strong>mkdir music</strong> will create a directory called "music".
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            So you've decided to run a file using the command-line? Well... there's a command for that too!

                        <p>
                            After navigating to the file's directory, this command will enable any Ubuntu user to run files compiled via GCC or any other programming language. Although the example above indicates a file name extension, please notice that, differently from some other operating systems, Ubuntu (and other Linux-based systems) do not care about file extensions (they can be anything, or nothing).
                            <strong>Keep in mind that the 'extension' will vary depending upon the language the source code is written in. Also, it is not possible, for compiled languages (like C and C++) to run the source code directly -- the file must be

                            Some possible extensions: ".c" for C source, ".cpp" for C++, ".rb" for Ruby, ".py" for Python, etc. Also, remember that (in the case of interpreted languages like Ruby & Python) 
                            <strong>you must have a version of that language installed on Ubuntu before trying to run files written with it.</strong>

                        <h3>System information Commands</h3>

                        <p>
                            <strong>df</strong>: The <strong>df</strong> command displays filesystem disk space usage for all mounted partitions. <strong>df -h</strong> is probably the most useful - it uses megabytes (M) and gigabytes (G) instead of blocks to report. (<strong>-h</strong> means "human-readable") 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>du</strong>: The <strong>du</strong> command displays the disk usage for a directory. It can either display the space used for all subdirectories or the total for the directory you run it on. Example:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code>

    1032    /media/floppy/files
    1036    /media/floppy/
    user@users-desktop:~$ du -sh /media/floppy
    1.1M    /media/floppy/
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            In the above example <strong>-s</strong>> means "Summary" and <strong>-h</strong>> means "Human Readable".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>free</strong>: The <strong>free</strong> command displays the amount of free and used memory in the system. <strong>free -m</strong> will give the information using megabytes, which is probably most useful for current computers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>top</strong>: The <strong>top</strong> ('table of processes') command displays information on your Linux system, running processes and system resources, including CPU, RAM & swap usage and total number of tasks being run. To exit <strong>top</strong>, press <strong>q</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>uname -a</strong>: The <strong>uname</strong> command with the <strong>-a</strong> option prints all system information, including machine name, kernel name & version, and a few other details. Most useful for checking which kernel you're using.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>lsb_release -a</strong>: The <strong>lsb_release -a</strong> command with the <strong>-a</strong> option prints version information for the Linux release you're running, for example:
                        </p>
                        <pre>

                            The <strong>adduser newuser</strong> command will create a new general user called "newuser" on your system, and to assign a password for the newuser account use <strong>passwd newuser</strong>.

                    <p>
                        The default behaviour for a command may usually be modified by adding a <strong>--option</strong> to the command. The <strong>ls</strong> command for example has an <strong>-s</strong> option so that <strong>ls -s</strong> will include file sizes in the listing. There is also a <strong>-h</strong> option to get those sizes in a "human readable" format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Options can be grouped in clusters so <strong>ls -sh</strong> is exactly the same command as <strong>ls -s -h</strong>. Most options have a long version, prefixed with two dashes instead of one, so even <strong>ls --size --hunam-readable</strong> is the same command. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>man command, info command</strong> and <strong>command --help</strong> are the most important tools at the command line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nearly every command and application in Linux will have a man (manual) file, so finding them is as simple as typing <strong>man "command"</strong>> to bring up a longer manual entry for the specified command. For example, <strong>man mv</strong>> will bring up the <strong>mv</strong> (move) manual. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Move up and down the man file with the arrow keys, and quit back to the command prompt with <strong>q</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>man man</strong> will bring up the manual entry for the man command, which is a good place to start!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>man intro</strong> is especially useful - it displays the "Introduction to user commands" which is a well-written, fairly brief introduction to the Linux command line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also <strong>info</strong> pages, which are generally more in-depth than <strong>man</strong> pages. Try <strong>info info</strong> for the introduction to info pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some software developers prefer <strong>info</strong> to <strong>man</strong> (for instance, GNU developers), so if you find a very widely used command or app that doesn't have a <strong>man</strong> page, it's worth checking for an <strong>info</strong> page. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Virtually all commands understand the <strong>-h</strong> (or <strong>--help</strong>) option which will produce a short usage description of the command and it's options, then exit back to the command prompt. Try <strong>man -h</strong> or <strong>man --help</strong> to see this in action. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caveat: It's possible (but rare) that a program doesn't understand the -h option to mean help. For this reason, check for a <strong>man</strong> or <strong>info</strong> page first, and try the long option <strong>--help</strong> before <strong>-h</strong>.

                            Users who have Konqueror installed will be pleased to find they can read and search man pages in a web browser context, prettified with their chosen desktop fonts and a little colour, by visiting <strong>man:/command</strong> in Konqueror's address bar. Some people might find this lightens the load if there's lots of documentation to read/search.

                        <p>
                            Often, you will be referred to instructions that require commands to be pasted into the terminal. You might be wondering why the text you've copied from a web page using <strong>Ctrl + C</strong> won't paste in with <strong>Ctrl + V</strong>. Surely you don't have to type in all those nasty commands and filenames? Relax. <strong>Ctrl + Shift + V</strong> pastes into a GNOME terminal; you can also do middle button click on your mouse (both buttons simultaneously on a two-button mouse) or right click and select Paste from the menu. However, if you want to avoid the mouse and yet paste it, use "Shift + Insert", to paste the command. If you have to copy it from another terminal / webpage, you can use "Ctrl + Insert" to copy.

                        <h3>More Ways to Run a Terminal</h3>

                        <p>
                            You can set your own keyboard shortcut to run a terminal. See 
                            <a class="externalInfo" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KeyboardShortcuts" alt="link to useful keyboard shortcuts in ubuntu">KeyboardShortcuts</a> 
                            for details of keyboard shortcuts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can run more than terminal - in tabs or separate windows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also install guake (GNOME), tilda (XFCE / LXDE/Mate) or yakuake (KDE) and have a terminal which appears and hides on shortcut key. This can be particularly useful if you use terminal a lot. Drop down terminals can make things a lot easier if you are trying to run a desktop enviroment with a non defualt window manager and something goes wrong drop down terminals can run the orginal window manager --replace to restore a previous option to make things much less painful.
